## Themida 3.1.8.0


### Overview

Themida is a powerful software protection system designed for software developers who wish to protect 
their applications against advanced reverse engineering and software cracking.
Themida uses the SecureEngine® protection system to achieve its goals, making it really difficult to break using the traditional and newest cracking tools.
Themida has been designed to completely stop novice and advanced crackers from cracking an application. 
That will avoid a considerable revenue loss from the distribution of cracked applications. Developers do not need any source code changes or programming 
experience to protect their applications with Themida.
